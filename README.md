# Box V2 Webhooks Demo

Webhooks let platforms like Box automatically notify your server when something important happens - like a file upload, a comment, or a task assignment. Instead of constantly polling for changes, your app can "listen" for events and respond in real time.

This is a lightweight [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server built to receive and verify [Box API webhook events](https://developer.box.com/guides/webhooks/). Itâ€™s designed as a hands-on learning tool for developers who want to:

- Understand how Box [v2 webhooks](https://developer.box.com/guides/webhooks/v2/) work
- Learn how to securely [verify webhook signatures](https://developer.box.com/guides/webhooks/v2/signatures-v2/)
- Explore both the [official SDK](https://github.com/box/box-node-sdk) and manual HMAC verification
- View webhook payloads in real time with clean, formatted output

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start an ngrok tunnel

Follow the [official ngrok setup guide](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) to install and authenticate ngrok.

Ngrok lets you create a publicly accessible URL that tunnels to a port on your local machine. This is required so Box can reach your webhook server.

By default, the Express server in this demo runs on port `8080`, so you can start ngrok with:

```
ngrok http 8080
```

### 3. Create a `.env` file

Copy the included `.env.sample` file and rename it to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Then fill in the following values:

```env
PORT=8080
PRIMARY_KEY=your_primary_signature_key
SECONDARY_KEY=your_secondary_signature_key
```

Set `PORT` to any available local port. This is the port your Express server will listen on for incoming webhook events from Box.

You can find your signature keys in the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console) by selecting your app, then navigating to **Webhooks** â†’ **Manage Signature Keys**.

## Usage (receiving events from Box)

### 1. Start the webhook server

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Express server locally (default: port `8080`).

### 2. Configure the webhook

1. Go to the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console) and select your app
2. Under **Webhooks**, click **Create Webhook** â†’ **V2**
3. In the **URL Address** field, enter your public ngrok forwarding URL:

```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/receiveWebhook
```

> Important: Do not use http://localhost:8080. Box needs a public URL to reach your local server. Replace localhost:8080 with your unique ngrok forwarding domain followed by /receiveWebhook
> Example: https://0d88-71-123-53-94.ngrok-free.app/receiveWebhook

4. Choose a **Content Type** (e.g., file or folder) to monitor, with one or more triggers (e.g., file uploaded, comment created)

### 3. Trigger the event

Make a change to the target content (e.g., upload a file or add a comment). This should trigger the webhook and send a request to your server.

### 4. View received events in your console

Your terminal will log a pretty-printed JSON payload with details about the webhook event!

## Signature verification

This app supports two ways to verify webhook signatures:

### Using the Box SDK (default)

```js
const isValid = Box.validateWebhookMessage(
  body,
  headers,
  primaryKey,
  secondaryKey
);
```

### Manually (toggle in code)

Comment the above line, then uncomment _this_ line in `server.js` to switch to manual validation:

```js
const isValid = verifySignatureManually(
  body,
  headers,
  primaryKey,
  secondaryKey
);
```

This uses `crypto.createHmac()` with the Box-provided signing algorithm.

## Example webhook payload

Below is an example of an event that is sent to the server when an event happens. See [Webhook (V2) Payload](https://developer.box.com/reference/resources/webhook-invocation/) for schema properties.

## Building on this foundation.

This webhook listener can serve as a starting point for enterprise-grade integrations. Here are a few examples of how teams could extend it:

- Reporting â€“ Log events to a centralized database to generate audit trails or usage summaries for compliance or analytics
- Syncing â€“ Mirror file or folder changes in other systems (e.g., CRMs, project management tools, or document repositories) to maintain consistency
- Automation â€“ Trigger downstream workflows like task assignment, alerting, or classification when key content changes occur
